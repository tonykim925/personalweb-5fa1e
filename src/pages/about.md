Hello! My name is Tony Kim and I am a workforce & people analyst living in the San Francisco Bay Area. My belief is that an organization’s success is dependent on its people. That is why my work is focused on advising organizations on how to make the best people decisions based on appropriate research and data analytics. I apply my professional and educational background in economics and Industrial-Organizational psychology to provide a unique and multidisciplinary perspective to people management.

Here are some of my skillsets:

*   **People Analytics**

     (R, SPSS, & fundamental SQL)

*   **Survey Methods & Analysis**

     (engagement, climate, well-being, etc.)

*   **Research Design**

*   **Experience in  HR functions**

     (selection/recruitment design, learning & development, organizational culture, change management, etc.)

*   **Consultanting **

    (HR + Strategy)

Please feel free to check out my portfolio to see some of my latest projects. For any inquiries please email me at *tony.kim925@gmail.com*.  I’ll get back to you as soon as possible.

Tony (Kwang Hyun) Kim
