##### Introduction

Graduate students in the San Francisco State University's Industrial-Organizational Psychology conducted the 4th annual survey to evaluate how well SF State embodies our Core Values and provided a report to administration. This year the students took a deep dive into the Core Value of Resilience by evaluating basic needs on campus. 1,086 students provided useable data during Spring 2019.
