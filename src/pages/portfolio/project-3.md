*Qualtrics version was created but is not currently available*

##### Note:

All 1086 participants of the study were told that their responses would only be shared with SFSU and its administration - not the general public. **Therefore, research results will not be shared in this portfolio.**

##### Introduction

Graduate students in the San Francisco State University's Industrial-Organizational Psychology conducted a Core Values survey to evaluate how well SF State embodies our Core Values and provided a report to administration. This year the students took a deep dive into the Core Value of Resilience by evaluating basic needs on campus. 1,086 students provided useable data during Spring 2019.

##### Method:

The project was split into three components:** survey design, survey recruitment, and survey analysis.**

###### Survey Design:

The\*\* survey design process started with a brainstorming session to define the goal of the project and to gather hypotheses, when evaluated, that would add the most value to the project\*\*. In 2018, San Francisco State University reported higher rates of student homelessness and food insecurity.  With that in mind, **our team decided to investigate both the causes of as well as the effects of food & housing insecurity.** With this goal in mind,\*\* we developed a list of constructs to evaluate and gathered pre-validated assessment tools\*\* (from academic literature) to measure each construct. We also consulted with the department of social work and public health with SFSU in developing the survey.

###### Survey Recruitment:

**Survey recruitment had two goals: attain a large sample and to attain a sample representative of SFSU's population.** In order to reduce sampling bias, the team attempted to collect data from a wide range of students from different backgrounds. This included having members of the team collecting at different locations and times all around the campus. Team members also recruited via faculty-approved classroom visits. Classes with a large array of students of different backgrounds were prioritized.  **In the end, the team collected 1086 useable survey data.**

###### Survey Analysis:

The survey analysis process started by scoring each construct based on the score guide from the original assessment. **Then each hypothesis was evaluated either through a series of t-tests, linear regression, and logistic regression.** Both main effects as well as moderation effects were evaluated. Results were there discussed and presented to the SFSU administration.
