##### Note:

All 1086 participants of the study were told that their responses would only be shared with SFSU and its administration - not the general public. Therefore, research results will not be shared in this portfolio.

##### Introduction

Graduate students in the San Francisco State University's Industrial-Organizational Psychology conducted a Core Values survey to evaluate how well SF State embodies our Core Values and provided a report to administration. This year the students took a deep dive into the Core Value of Resilience by evaluating basic needs on campus. 1,086 students provided useable data during Spring 2019.
