##### Introduction

Under the guidance of Dr. Kevin Eschleman, graduate students in the Seminar in Organizational Psychology (PSY 760, Spring 2019) conducted the 4th annual survey to evaluate how well SF State embodies our Core Values and provide a report to administration. This year we took a deep dive into the Core Value of Resilience by evaluating basic needs on campus. 1,086 students provided useable data during Spring 2019.
