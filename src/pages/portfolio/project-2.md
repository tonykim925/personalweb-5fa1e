##### Introduction

The[ **Interdisciplinary Center for Healthy Workplaces (ICHW)**](https://healthyworkplaces.berkeley.edu/) partnered with [**Transamerica Corporation**](https://www.transamerica.com/individual/) to develop an Employer Guide that will enable organizations (with an emphasis on small and medium-sized) to find a workplace wellness program that fits their specific constraints.  Small and medium organizations face a number of limitations given their size and financial reserves, but employeesâ€™ health and well-being needs are constant regardless of organization size. Employees need a safe, socially supportive, and health-promoting work environment that not only supports their wellness but also enables them to do their best work. We have examined the available literature on wellness programs in general, and we have created a method based on our research for how organization leaders can design an effective wellness strategy that fits their constraints.

##### Project Goals:

1.  Identify key facilitators and barriers to successful wellness program implementation

2.  Understand the various types of wellness programs and how each of them "fit" within various types of organizations

3.  Provide a guide for organizational leaders to help them properly design an effective wellness strategy that fits their constraints

##### Methods Used:

1.  Literature Review (200+ research articles)
2.  Focus groups (20 + focus groups with small and medium-sized organizations
3.  Survey (1540 employers + 2892 employees with Transamerica Corporation Network)

##### My Role:

1.  Located and gathered relevant information from 55+ research articles

2.  Audited literature review coding from other researchers

3.  Conducted 15 focus groups including groups of executives, managers, and HR personnel

4.  Analyzed survey and focus group data to identify trends and insights regarding wellness program participation
