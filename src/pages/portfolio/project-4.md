Full Training Program Proposal (PDF):  https://tinyurl.com/y22wmwuc

##### Introduction

During my Training Program Development course, our core project was to develop a mock training proposal for a company of our choice. My group of three (Jennifer Stewart, Vivian Li, and myself) chose Reddit a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website. Reddit at the time had tripled in size in the span of two years through the means of targeted recruitment. With 95% of the employees having tenure of fewer than two years, we recognized that Reddit would struggle in developing strong and reliable teams.

Understanding Redditâ€™s current challenges, we recommended implementing a teamleadership training designed to increase the cohesion, performance, and organizationalcommitment of new teams. The proposal is split into four parts:

1.  Organizational Details

2.  Training Needs Assessment

3.  Training Program Design

4.  Training Evaluation Plan

##### Project Goal:

To develop a leadership training program fully tailored to the employees, teams, and leaders of Reddit. Every logistical component of the program is developed by anticipating the participant's needs and takes initiative to address problems based on the understanding of the workforce. The program also takes into consideration a need to have a structured evaluation plan to confirm success or a need to reevaluate the training design.
