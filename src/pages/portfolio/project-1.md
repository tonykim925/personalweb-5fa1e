##### Introduction

[](https://tonykim925.github.io/ibm-dataset-analysis/ibm-dataset-analysis.pdf)For organizations, turnover is often extremely costly. Resources must be allocated to finding a suitable replacement, and even after finding someone, the organization must invest in the replacement's learning and development. Because turnover comes at a premium, organizational psychologists often use turnover as a way to persuade company leaders to better care for their employees. This is one reason why I believe company culture, engagement, and well-being have recently become such hot topics.
