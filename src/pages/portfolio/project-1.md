##### Introduction

[](https://tonykim925.github.io/ibm-dataset-analysis/ibm-dataset-analysis.pdf)For organizations, turnover is often extremely costly. Resources must be allocated to finding a suitable replacement, and even after finding someone, the organization must invest in the replacement's learning and development. Because turnover comes at a premium, organizational psychologists often use turnover as a way to persuade company leaders to better care for their employees. This is one reason why I believe company culture, engagement, and well-being have recently become such hot topics.

1.  The company is losing a **large amount of young talent** as 55% of all attrition came from employees between 18-32. Also, 36% of employees within the 18-25 age bracket, as well as 22% of employees within the 26-32 bracket, left indicating the company's struggles maintaining younger talent

2.  Sales representatives had the highest attrition at 40% with laboratory technicians and human resources following at 24% and 23%. After investigation, **low income, as well as low job satisfaction ratings, may be strong contributors to the high attrition rate within sales representatives, laboratory technicians and human resources.**

3.  \**While environment satisfaction does seem to be a factor contributing to attrition across job roles, it was most evident for healthcare representatives and managers.** There was a large gap in environmental satisfaction between those healthcare representatives and managers who stayed and those who left. Further investigation on what environmental issues are negatively affecting those roles will be critical.

4.  \**While job satisfaction does seem to be a factor contributing to attrition across job roles, it was most evident for sales reps, laboratory technicians, and human resources.** There was a large gap in job satisfaction between those sales reps, laboratory technicians, and human resources who stayed and those who left. Further investigation on what issues are negatively affecting those roles will be critical.

5.  The analysis shows that for the employees at IBM, **income did not have a strong influence on job satisfaction.** This suggests that low job satisfaction and income are two different factors.

6.  Although I hypothesized that **job and environment satisfaction would be lower for those who worked overtime, that did not seem to be the case.** Further analysis on why job and environment satisfaction are low for certain job roles should be evaluated.

7.  Although overtime did not seem to affect job and environment satisfaction, a larger percentage of those who worked overtime left the organization compared to those who didn't.
