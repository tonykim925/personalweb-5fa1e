##### Note:

*This project uses the *[*IBM Retention Dataset*](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)*, which is a fictional dataset created by IBM data scientists. *

##### Introduction

[](https://tonykim925.github.io/ibm-dataset-analysis/ibm-dataset-analysis.pdf)For organizations, turnover is often extremely costly. Resources must be allocated to finding a suitable replacement, and even after finding someone, the organization must invest in the replacement's learning and development. Because turnover comes at a premium, organizational psychologists often use turnover as a way to persuade company leaders to better care for their employees. This is one reason why I believe company culture, engagement, and well-being have recently become such hot topics.

Here I have created a report which used the [IBM Retention Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset) to better understand the reasons why employees are leaving the organization. My analysis focused on exploratory data analysis and was done to provide a better understanding of the data and to help develop informed hypotheses.

##### [](https://tonykim925.github.io/ibm-dataset-analysis/ibm-dataset-analysis.pdf)[](https://tonykim925.github.io/ibm-dataset-analysis/ibm-dataset-analysis.pdf)Project Goals:

1.  Execute preliminary exploratory data analysis to develop hypotheses on why people are leaving the organization

2.  Showcase how to clean and prep data (especially survey data)

3.  Explore ways to communicate data through data visualization using ggplot2 package

4.  Have fun with a new dataset

##### Skills Utilized:

1.  Data Wrangling (mainly dplyr)

2.  Survey Analysis

3.  Data Visualization (ggplot2)

4.  Report Creation

5.  Exploratory Data Analysis

##### My Role:

This is a personal project. Therefore, I have planned, designed, and executed the project from the beginning to the end. The dataset was created and shared on Kaggle.
